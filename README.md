# PandemicLegacyS2Geekery

The primary purpose of this project is to show my friends how much of a nerd I am.

The secondary purpose is to test different strategies for deck management in Pandemic Legacy Season 2.

The purpose of this update to the readme is to make sure the github integration is working properly.
